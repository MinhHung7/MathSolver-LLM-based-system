### 🧠 Mistral Fine-Tune for Math Solver using Unsloth, Gradio & OpenAI API
This project showcases how to fine-tune the powerful Mistral language model using the Unsloth library to build a robust and interactive math problem solver. It combines multiple components to enhance the user experience and ensure high accuracy:
- 🔧 Mistral Fine-Tuning with Unsloth for step-by-step mathematical reasoning.
- 🌐 Gradio Interface for easy, browser-based user interaction.
- 🧠 OpenAI API Integration to:
  - 🖼️ Extract math problems from uploaded images (OCR + interpretation).
  - ✅ Validate and correct Mistral's output if one or more of the generated answers are incorrect.
### 🚀 Project Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in educational tools, especially for solving math problems. However, base models often struggle with step-by-step mathematical reasoning. In this project, we:
🧠 Technologies Used
- Mistral — Lightweight, high-performance LLM.
- Unsloth — Memory-optimized library for fast fine-tuning with LoRA.
- Gradio — Web-based UI for testing and deployment.
- OpenAI API — Used for image-to-text (problem extraction) and output validation.
